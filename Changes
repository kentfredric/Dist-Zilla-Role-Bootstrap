 [00 Major]
 - This distribution has a few changes that are major enough that non-perl toolchains may need to pay attention.

   Module::Build train.

 - x.y.z becomes x.abydez, aka: Floats. If this is a problem, please normalise versions downstream.
 - Versioning scheme change is primary reason for 1.XXX on the box.

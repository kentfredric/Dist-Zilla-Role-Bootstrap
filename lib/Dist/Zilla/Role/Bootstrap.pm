=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap - Shared logic for bootstrap things.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

For consuming plugins:

    use Moose;
    with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap';

    sub bootstrap {
        my $bootstrap_root = $_[0]->_bootstrap_root;
        # Do the actual bootstrap work here
        $_[0]->_add_inc('./some/path/here');
    }

For users of plugins:

    [Some::Plugin::Name]
    try_built = 0 ; # use / as the root to bootstrap
    try_built = 1 ; # try to use /Dist-Name-.*/ instead of /

    fallback  = 0 ; # don't bootstrap at all if /Dist-Name-.*/ matches != 1 things
    fallback  = 1 ; # fallback to / if /Dist-Name-.*/ matches != 1 things

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 C<bootstrap>

Any user specified C<bootstrap> method will be invoked during C<plugin_from_config>.

This is B<AFTER> C<< ->new >>, B<AFTER> C<< ->BUILD >>, and B<AFTER> C<dzil>'s internal C<plugin_from_config> steps.

This occurs within the C<register_component> phase of the plug-in loading and configuration.

This also occurs B<BEFORE> C<Dist::Zilla> attaches the plug-in into the plug-in stash.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<distname>

The name of the distribution.

This value is vivified by asking C<< zilla->name >>.

Usually this value is populated by C<dist.ini> in the property C<name>

However, occasionally, this value is discovered by a C<plugin>.

In such a case, that plugin cannot be bootstrapped, because that plugin B<MUST> be loaded prior to bootstrap.

=head2 C<try_built>

This attribute controls how the consuming C<plugin> behaves.

=over 4

=item * false B<(default)> : bootstrapping is only done to C<PROJECTROOT/lib>

=item * true : bootstrap attempts to try C<< PROJECTROOT/<distname>-<version>/lib >>

=back

=head2 C<fallback>

This attribute is for use in conjunction with C<try_built>

=over 4

=item * C<false> : When C<< PROJECTROOT/<distname>-<version> >> does not exist, don't perform any bootstrapping

=item * C<true> B<(default)> : When C<< PROJECTROOT/<distname>-<version> >> does not exist, bootstrap to C<< PROJECTROOT/lib >>

=back

=head2 C<try_built_method>

This attribute controls how C<try_built> behaves when multiple directories exist that match C<< PROJECTROOT/<distname>-.* >>

Two valid options at this time:

=over 4

=item * C<mtime> B<(default)> : Pick the directory with the most recent C<mtime>

=item * C<parseversion> : Attempt to parse versions on all candidate directories and use the one with the largest version.

=back

Prior to C<0.2.0> this property did not exist, and default behavior was to assume C<0 Candidates> and C<2 or more Candidates> were the same problem.

=head1 PRIVATE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<_cwd>

=head2 C<_bootstrap_root>

Internal: This is the real legwork, and resolves the base directory using the bootstrap resolution protocol.

It should always return a project root of some kind, whether it be a source tree, or built source tree.

It can also return C<undef> if discovery concludes that no bootstrap can or should be performed.

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS

=head2 C<_pick_latest_mtime>

"Latest" C<mtime> candidate selector

    my $directory = $self->_pick_latest_mtime(@directory_objects)

=head2 C<_get_candidate_version>

Attempt to resolve a version from a directory name

    my $version = $self->_get_candidate_version($directory_object)

B<NOTE:> At this time, the presence of C<-TRIAL> is simply stripped and ignored

=head2 C<_pick_latest_parseversion>

"Latest" C<version> candidate selector

    my $directory = $self->_pick_latest_parseversion(@directory_objects)

=head2 C<_pick_candidate>

Pick a directory from a list of candidates using the method described by C<try_built_method>

    my $directory = $self->_pick_candidate( @directory_objects );

=head2 C<_add_inc>

Internal: Used to perform the final step of injecting library paths into C<@INC>

    $self->_add_inc("$libraryPath");
